You are a senior consumer app designer and full-stack engineer building a highly polished MVP for a lightweight social product called Bet That. The goal is to create something that feels fast, trustworthy, intuitive, and shareable, with obsessive attention to UX details and edge cases. This is not a gambling app and does not process real payments of any kind. There is no monetization, no paywalls, no account creation, and no authentication. The product exists purely to organize casual bets among friends, track participation, calculate outcomes, and clearly show who owes what after the event ends.

Bet That allows anyone to create a small, informal bet around everyday events such as sports moments, school outcomes, friendly challenges, or pop-culture predictions. A user lands on the app and immediately understands how it works through a minimal onboarding experience that explains, in plain language, that they can create a bet, share a link, let friends join, and the app will handle all calculations. Onboarding should be extremely lightweight, one or two screens at most, with a strong primary call to action to create a bet and a secondary option to view an example bet. There should be no friction, no signup, and no references to money handling or payments, only clarity and trust.

Once onboarded, the user can create a bet from a simple dashboard. Creating a bet involves entering a clear event title, an optional description, a bet close date and time, and a list of possible outcomes, typically between two and six options. The creator can also add optional rules or notes to clarify how the bet should be interpreted. The creator provides a name or nickname, but this does not create an account and is only used for display purposes. After the bet is created, the app generates a unique, shareable URL that can be sent to friends through any messaging platform. This link is the primary way people access and interact with the bet.

The event page is the most important screen in the entire product and must be designed with extreme care. It should be clean, distraction-free, and optimized for mobile use since most people will arrive via a shared link. At the top, the event title and description are shown along with a countdown indicating how much time remains before betting closes. Below this, the available outcomes are displayed as large, clearly tappable options. Friends joining the bet can enter their name or nickname, select one outcome, and enter any wager amount they want. There are no limits or preset values for wager amounts. As users add their wagers, the app dynamically shows the total prize pool across all participants, the amount wagered on each outcome, and the potential payout for each participant if their chosen outcome wins. This feedback should be immediate and easy to understand so users feel confident in what they are committing to.

After a user submits their wager, their choice is locked and they receive a clear confirmation. They should then be able to see aggregate information about the bet, including how many people have joined, how the total pool is distributed across outcomes, and what the implied payouts look like. Users should not be able to edit or remove their wagers after submission, and the app should gracefully handle cases where multiple people enter the same name. The entire experience should feel transparent, fair, and deterministic, with no ambiguity about how results will be calculated.

When the betting period ends, the bet transitions into a resolution phase controlled by the creator through their private, link-based dashboard. The creator selects the winning outcome, and the app automatically calculates the results. This includes determining which participants won, which lost, and exactly how much each losing participant owes to the winners based on the total prize pool and wager distribution. The results page should present this information in a very clear, human-readable format, such as a list stating who owes whom and how much. The app should explicitly emphasize that settlement happens offline however the group prefers and that Bet That does not facilitate or track payments.

The creator dashboard is accessible only via the creator’s unique link and does not require authentication. It shows a list of bets the creator has made, their current status such as open, closed, or resolved, and provides quick actions like sharing the event link, closing betting early, resolving the outcome, or viewing final results. The system should be robust against edge cases such as bets with very few participants, creators abandoning a bet, or users arriving after betting has closed, and it should always fail gracefully with clear messaging.

Visually, the app should use a white background with dark, forest-style green accents inspired by natural tree tones. The design should be minimal and modern, avoiding anything that feels like a casino, sportsbook, crypto product, or financial app. Rounded cards, soft shadows, clean typography, and calm spacing are preferred. The overall feeling should be neutral, trustworthy, and lightweight, encouraging people to share links without hesitation.

From a technical perspective, the app should be simple, fast, and reliable. It should rely heavily on URL-based access rather than accounts, use a straightforward data model for events, outcomes, participants, and wagers, and implement deterministic payout calculations that are easy to audit and explain. Performance should be prioritized, and every screen should have a clear primary action with no unnecessary complexity. The final product should feel launch-ready, instantly understandable, and something users naturally want to drop into a group chat when they say, “Bet that.”
